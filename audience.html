			<p> The main audience of Rocks to Sky are people who enjoy rock 
				climbing and bouldering.  People who visits this site would be those interested in 
				rock climbing. </p>
			<p> For those who are experienced in rock climbing would click on the contact button 
				to look for the address of our facility.  </p>
			<p> For those who are new to rock climbing, there are information
				on the introduction page to learn more about rock climbing.  They would also easily 
				navigate to the other two pages; Catalog and contact to find out more about our pricing. </p>
			<p> I believe that the design and page layout is justified for targeting people who are interested
				in rock climbing, readable font size for more senior climbers to locate our facility number and address. </p>
			<p> This site also has colour schemes which helps people's eyes to focus on the contents. </p>
